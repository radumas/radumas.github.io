I'm a recent graduate from MIT with a Master of Science in Transportation and a Master in City Planning who is passionate about 
helping create a future of sustainable urban passenger transportation systems. I'm currently looking for opportunities in one of the following areas:  
- New technologies/apps that provide/encourage non-SOV options  
- Open-source tools to enable citizens and advocacy groups to more fully participate in transportation planning/decision-making  - Planning to reduce GHG from transportation at a city/state level with a focus on knowledge transfer to other regions  
- Planning for autonomous vehicles

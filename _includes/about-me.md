I'm a recent graduate from MIT with a Master of Science in Transportation and a Master in City Planning who is passionate about 
reducing GHG emissions from passenger transportation. I'm currently looking for opportunities in one of the following areas:  
 - New technologies/apps that provide/encourage people non-SOV car options  
 - Open-source tools to enable citizens and advocacy groups to more fully participate in transportation planning/decision-making   
 - Planning to reduce GHG from transportation at a city/state level with a focus on transferring that process to other regions

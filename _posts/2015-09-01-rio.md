I spent the summer of 2015 on a [MIT MISTI](http://misti.mit.edu/student-programs/location/brazil)-funded internship at the [Freight Transportation Lab](http://www.ltc.coppe.ufrj.br/) (LTC) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. [Here is a blog](http://www.radumas.info/coppe-ltc) containing a sample of some maps and some tutorials I worked on while I was there for 3.5 months.

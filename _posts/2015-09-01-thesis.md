During my 3 years at MIT, I did research with the [MIT Transit Lab](https://transit.mit.edu). I helped adapt an algorithm to determine how individual customers use the MBTA based on their fare data. From a month of this data I compared differences in commute travel times. You can download a pdf [here](https://radumas.github.io/thesis/raw_thesis/Thesis%20Final.pdf).

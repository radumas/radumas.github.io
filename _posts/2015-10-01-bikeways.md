While I interned at the [Boston Cyclists Union](http://bostoncyclistsunion.org/), I developed an [online map](http://www.radumas.info/bikeways4everybody) on which cyclists can draw routes and place markers where they think infrastructure should be improved. Analysis then showed where demand for better infrastructure is greatest. The code is freely available [here](https://github.com/radumas/bikeways4everybody).
